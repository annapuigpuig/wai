## Cooking Code Game

This game aims to teach programming using a metaphor of cooking and restaurants. The player takes different roles, a Chef in a kitchen and a waiter in a restaurant.

#### Role of Chef

The game is based on the metaphor of a Burger, set in a futuristic era where robots and humans coexist as equals. The player plays the role of a chef, having to learn to read the orders that arrive and carry them out successfully. The main difficulty is that the requests do not arrive in natural language, but in a kind of pseudo-code.

#### Role of Waiter

In this mode, the player will be a waiter so that she/he must
go to the different tables of the restaurant collecting clients' orders. The main diffculty will be to translate
these orders, that they receive in natural language, into a language similar to pseudo-code. The player grabs and locate panels of food (drinks, bread, cheese, etc.) which in fact represent programming constructs (sequential instructions, if else, for).
