## Serious Games projects

This research line encloses a set of Final Degree Projects of Computer Science 
focused on teaching with games. We mainly focus on teach programming in CS1 courses and also maths (fractions, geometry) to students of Primary and Secundary School. 
We aim to provide teachers with an aiding tool, specifically in the field of geometry 
teaching during the last years of primary school. 

Thus, the main goal is to design and create games using Unity with a series of  
learning activities allowing students to 
progress in an entertaining and engaging way, having them overcome several challenges.

In some games, each student will have their own user and the game will be flexible enough to enable 
the teacher to analyse their evolution and to identify their difficulties. 

### Serious games to teach Maths in Primary and Secondary School

In these games, the teacher will also be able to customize the game, choosing which skills to train, 
and adding new activities and new 2D and 3D shapes among other geometric concepts.
