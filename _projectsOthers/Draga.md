We focus on foster innovation in the analysis and understanding of architectural prehistoric remains from Neolithic. This historical period has been conceptualized as the most transcendental social, cultural and economic transition in the history of Humanity, when populations that had been hunter-and gatherers began to adopt a farming economy. The project will provide new recreations of the past using Serious Games and Artificial Intelligence to improve assets conservation while bringing new engaging ways of education in the past.
The project aims to develop virtual e-learning systems based both on simulation of social dynamics in the past (artificial societies based on agents distributed simulation) and “serious games”, that is, computer systems with the aesthetics of a videogame, but based on rigorous historical research and introducing academic knowledge relevant to education of children.
