## EcoSea sandbox

EcoSea's sandbox allows teachers and even students to freely create their own level that follows
the EcoSea game's rules. This will allow the game to go much further, since you will be able to create a
level that perfectly fits your needs in case you find the base levels not complete enough. You could
add something new, treat some aspects differently or even adapt it to a specific student or group of
students.
